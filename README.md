# Scala Kafka Lab

## Goal

When integrating multiple complex technologies, especially in a secondary language, it's often very helpful to see full implementations and even their runtime behavior. To that end, this is a collection of self-contained Kafka clients in Scala intended for local experimentation.

## Clients by Technology Stack

* **zio-producer**
* **zio-consumer**
